Create two distinct planning domains using Pyhop and the Python programming language. 
	Domain One:
		Two distinct types of objects
		Three operators
		Two methods
		Two distinct starting states, at least one of which yields a plan containing at least five steps
		
	Domain Two:
		Four distinct types of objects
		Five operators
		Three methods
			At least one of these must have another method in its task decomposition
		Three distinct starting states
			At least one of these must yield a plan containing at least ten steps
		
	After completing the domains, write a 2-3 page paper containing the following:
		Introductory paragraph or two describing target domains and why you initially believed that they were suitable for planning
		For each domain, one to two paragraphs describing how you encoded that domain. 
			Pay particular attention to discussing the tradeoffs involved in the encoding. 
			What domain features are represented explicitly? What domain features have been 
			abstracted away? Why did you perform those abstractions? How good were the plans 
			that were produced? What criteria do you have for a "good plan"?
		Write a concluding paragraph discussing the utility of planning in general. 
			Under what circumstances is it worthwhile to build and use a planner? When is it 
			not appropriate? Justify your answers based on the experiences in this project 
			you described earlier in the paper.
